# AWS Workload Planner

Plan AWS compute architectures from a short workload interview. The planner writes a Mermaid diagram, a graph audit, and a versioned JSON plan.

## Install

Requirements:

- zsh
- jq
- Node.js and npm, to install [Mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) and render diagrams
- chafa for an optional terminal image preview
- AWS CLI is optional; when present, its configured Region is used if no Region is selected

Clone the repository and install Mermaid CLI:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ammaraldawood/aws.git
cd aws
npm install --global @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

## Use

Run the planner and answer the questions:

```sh
AWS_SETUP_REGION=us-east-1 bin/aws-plan/aws-plan
```

You can instead set `AWS_SETUP_REGION` in `config/local.env` or `~/.config/pc-aws/local.env`. The planner does not need AWS credentials to create a plan.

To start from the included configuration example:

```sh
cp config/local.env.example config/local.env
```

Set `AWS_SETUP_REGION` in the copied file.

The interview covers workload shape, compute, memory, interaction, storage, interruption tolerance, and orchestration. Press `e` at a yes/no question for examples that explain when to choose either answer.

The planner saves these files under `out/`:

- `architecture.mmd` — Mermaid source
- `architecture.svg` and `architecture.png` — rendered diagrams
- `graph-audit.md` — selected resources and relationships
- `plan.json` — versioned plan with workload requirements, selected services, resources, relationships, and rationale
- `plans/<plan-id>.json` — an archived copy of each generated plan

Mermaid source is still available when Mermaid CLI is not installed. Without chafa, the planner prints the output paths without a terminal image preview.

In the graph, circles are AWS services, boxes are concrete resources, and dark nodes on connections name the relationship. Dotted arrows represent setup or configuration; solid arrows represent architecture integrations. Category colors group services and resources.

## Example workflows

Each example follows a real workload choice. Together, the diagrams show the services, resources, and relationship types the planner can recommend.

### Interactive GPU workstation

You downloaded a Linux 3D visualization application, but your laptop cannot handle its scenes and you need to work in its GUI. A GPU instance supplies compute and DCV supplies the remote display. EBS holds the working set, while S3 keeps inputs and results independent of the instance. S3 Express appears only when measurements show an object-access latency bottleneck; Cost Explorer supports reviewing spend afterward.

### macOS render farm

Your rendering plug-in only runs on macOS and you have enough independent frames to need a farm. Deadline Cloud schedules work on customer-managed macOS workers running on EC2 Mac hosts. DCV supports previews and debugging, while S3 stores project files and job attachments. EC2 Mac capacity uses a Dedicated Host. [Deadline Cloud customer-managed fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deadline-cloud/latest/userguide/manage-cmf.html) and [Amazon DCV on EC2 Mac](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/setting-up-installing-macos-prerequisites.html) describe those requirements.

### Containerized parameter sweep

You need to run thousands of independent simulation inputs, and each run can restart from durable state. ECR stores the container image; AWS Batch queues jobs and scales EC2 workers with Spot capacity. S3 holds inputs and outputs, and CloudWatch receives job logs. A Batch job references a queue and job definition when submitted. [AWS Batch components](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/batch_components.html)

### Distributed Trainium training with AWS PCS

Your training workload needs Slurm, tightly coupled node communication, and a shared high-throughput filesystem. AWS PCS manages the Slurm control plane; EFA supports node communication, FSx for Lustre provides shared data, and Trainium supplies compute. The queue routes jobs to its associated compute node group. [AWS PCS queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pcs/latest/userguide/getting-started_create-queue.html)

### Inferentia batch inference with AWS PCS

You run a large, restartable inference workload across compatible Inferentia nodes and want AWS-managed Slurm. PCS provides the cluster and queue, while EFA and FSx support communication and shared data. The compute node group selects Inferentia capacity; verify the instance family, Neuron image, quotas, and Region for the application.

### Trainium training with ParallelCluster

Your team wants distributed Trainium training but prefers to manage its Slurm cluster lifecycle with ParallelCluster. EFA and FSx for Lustre support the tightly coupled job, and DCV provides a graphical access path for interactive work. ParallelCluster provisions the EC2 capacity.

### Inferentia batch inference with ParallelCluster

You already operate a Slurm workflow for batch inference and want to add compatible Inferentia instances. ParallelCluster manages the cluster lifecycle; EFA and FSx support communication and shared data. Neuron software and the custom AMI are part of the cluster configuration.

### Managed Trainium training with SageMaker AI

You want SageMaker AI to run distributed Trainium training rather than manage the cluster lifecycle yourself. S3 holds durable artifacts, ECR stores the training image, and FSx for Lustre provides shared high-throughput data. EFA supports communication between compatible instances, and CloudWatch receives job logs.

### Inferentia-backed SageMaker endpoint

Your model is ready for inference and its Neuron stack supports an Inferentia-backed endpoint. SageMaker hosts the endpoint, S3 stores model artifacts, and ECR provides the custom inference image. An execution role grants the service access to those resources and CloudWatch logs. Confirm model, framework, instance type, and Region compatibility.

### Event-driven document assistant with Bedrock Knowledge Bases

Your team is building a document assistant. An S3 upload triggers a Lambda function packaged in ECR; the function handles application logic and invokes the Bedrock Runtime API. Separately, a Bedrock Knowledge Base uses S3 documents as its source and S3 Vectors as its vector store. [Bedrock Knowledge Bases with S3 Vectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-vectors-bedrock-kb.html)

These plans are architecture recommendations. Check regional availability, quotas, instance support, operating-system images, Neuron compatibility, and networking requirements before implementing a workflow.

## Development

Run the planner interviews in an isolated temporary directory:

```sh
zsh tests/check.zsh
```
